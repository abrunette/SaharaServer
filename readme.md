This repo contains the source code of the Sahara Mobile shopping application server, final project for our Softwate Engineering class. (CS441) 

This server has been written in C# and acts as a bridge between the Client and the database.  

In theory it supports multiple connections thanks to multithreading.  

Packages used:  
  ProtoBuf-net.   
  Dapper  
  System.SQLite.net.
